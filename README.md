## Introduction
Metabolites, signifying a complex interplay between genotype, behaviour, and environment, provide a unique readout of human health and disease. The study established a human metbolome-phenome atlas, providing over 1.4 million associations between 313 plasma metabolites and a comprehensive range of human phenotypes (comprising 1,386 diseases and 3,142 traits) across 274,241 longitudinally followed (median 14.9 years) participants from UK Biobank. The present atlas was approved by UK Biobank under application number 202239 and 19542.
The atlas mapped distinct metabolite evolutionary trajectories to disease development, revealing key time points of metabolic changes over a decade preceding onset. Machine-learning-based Metabolic Risk Score signified the top metabolites as potential biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting diseases. In search of promising therapeutic targets, the atlas uncovered causally related metabolite-disease pairs and shared genetic determinants.

To facilitate an in-depth exploration of the detailed results, an [interactive webtool](https://metabolome-phenome-atlas.com/) was structured into four sections: Epidemiological association (disease-/trait-/metabolite-wide association analysis), Evolutional trajectory (lifespan and disease-span trajectory analysis), Genomic association (MR and colocalization analysis), and Diagnosis and prediction (machine learning classification analysis). The webtool was established under the CCBY-NC-ND 4.0 license for non-commercial use only.
